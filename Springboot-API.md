# Workshop : Springboot Java Restful webservice 

This course will cover building a restful API using Java Sprinboot and integrating it with a Mongo DB. 

  
## Course Description 

In this course we use popular tools and framework to build a working API which interacts with a MongoDB data store. The tools are selected based on populraity on enterprise-level application development. 

### Spring Framework

[Spring Framework](https://spring.io "Spring Framework") is the most poplular application development framework for developing enterprise software applications. 

It is built on top of Java Enterprise Edition frawework and used by milion of developers to build resillient , high-performing , scalable , maintanable applications worldwide. 

You will learn the basics of Spring Framework and why it is so popular and powerfull. 

### MongoDB 
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com "MongoDB") is the most popular no-sql database outthere. We will create an instance on MongoDB Cloud and then connect to it from our Java API. 

## Requirements 
  - Basic Java programming knowledge
  - Basic database design
  
## Program outcomes
After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
* Set-up working environment for developing a java application. (Installing IntelliJ Idea , JDK). 
* understand the basic of Restful Webservices.
* work with Rest client using Postman(testing your Restful API).
* Undestand 3 layer application architecure (Controller , Service , Data access)
* Develop a Springboot application using Spring Starter.
* Design and build a resful webservice (API from scratch using Spring Framework). 
* Stand up MongoDB instances on MongoDB Cloud. 
* Undestand the basics of No-SQL databases ( Collections , Documents , Feilds).
* Understand the value of unit testing and how to automate testing your Springboot Rest API using JUnit and Mockito.  

## Next Step
**In the next series of workshops we will go all cloud . We will turn our Springboot Rest API into a _Cloud-Native_ application, deploying it on _Microsoft Azure_** . Then We look into buidling Micorservices using Sping Cloud.
