# Workshop : Springboot Java Restful webservice 

This course will cover building a restful API connection to a no/SQL database (Mongo DB) 

  
## Course Description 

In this course we use popular and tools and framework used in enterprise software development to build a working API which interacts with a MongoDB data store. 

### Spring Framework

[Spring Framework](https://spring.io "Spring Framework") is the most poplular application development framework for developing enterprise software applications. 

It is built on top of Java Enterprise Edition frawework and used by milion of developers to build resillient , high-performing , sclable , maintanable applications worldwide.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com "MongoDB") is the most popular no-sql database outthere. We will create an instance on MongoDB Cloud and then connect to it from our Java API. 

## Requirements 
  - Basic Java programming
  - Basic database design
  
## Program outcomes
After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
* understand the basic of Restful Webservices.
* work with Rest client (testing your Restful API).
